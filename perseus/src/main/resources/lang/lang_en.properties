The development of COCTEAU will have as main partners a core team of POLIMI (leader), FRA, CEPS and ISINNOVA and will be tested within the Mission Oriented Innovation Policies of the EU.
default-index-fragment.description-aggregator = The AGGREGATOR Database is the Atlas of Global Governance REGulation and Europe's AcTORness. The main components of AGGREGATOR are <ul class="mb-0"><li>The Data Repository: A collection of diverse datasets, for example a dataset of EU legal documents, a dataset on global governance instruments, or analytical datasets on EU differentiated integration.</li><li>Interactive data visualisations: An interactive visualisation and analysis of EU legal documents as well as an interactive visualisation of key events in global governance.</li><li>Research papers and analyses on diverse challenges and opportunities in global governance, for example an analysis of EU actorness.</li></ul>

agg-repo-fragment.eurlex-tab = CEPS EurLex
agg-repo-fragment.eurlex-desc-1 = Text is one of the primary means of doing politics: laws, speeches, \
  position papers or communications are all means of negotiating, communicating or implementing political \
  decisions. As more and more digital texts are becoming available online and as text-as-data methods advance, \
  the vast amount of unstructured digital data holds immense potential for political scientists.
agg-repo-fragment.eurlex-desc-2 = The CEPS EurLex dataset collection organizes thousands of key EU documents in \
  structured format, ready for machine analysis. The goal of these datasets is to provide researchers and \
  policy-makers with the raw data to enable them to better understand EU governance at scale. All of the datasets \
  were scraped from the official eur-lex.europa.eu website with the programming languages R and Python. \
  The data was therefore not manually annotated, but it represents the information on the eur-lex website as is, \
  converted into structured tabular format. Each dataset represents one document in one row and metadata variables \
  in several columns.
agg-repo-fragment.diff-int-title = EU Differentiated Integration in Regulations between 1958-2019
agg-repo-fragment.diff-int-tab = Differentiated Integration
agg-repo-fragment.diff-int-desc-1 = Can quantitative and qualitative methods be combined to create an accurate and \
  scalable analysis of the European Union's legal acquis of more than 140.000 laws? This analysis investigates this \
  question using the example of 'Differentiated Integration' (DI). A 'differentiation' is an exemption in EU law \
  where at least member state does not apply certain rules which otherwise apply to all member states. The Euro is \
  one example where certain EU member states like Denmark have decided not to apply the rules related to the Euro. \
  These kinds of differentiations have so far mostly been analysed through case studies or manual coding of a \
  limited number of EU legal acts.
agg-repo-fragment.diff-int-desc-2 = This analysis presents an attempt to translate the manual analysis of EU legal \
  acts into machine search patterns which automatically detect cases of differentiation. To this end, we collected a \
  dataset of 92.215 EU regulations in machine readable format, representing almost the entire acquis of EU regulations \
  since 1958. We then manually analysed the literature and samples of laws to identify how differentiation is \
  expressed in EU legal texts. Based on this analysis, we created a set of machine search patterns \
  ('regular expressions' in the programming language Python) and scanned each sentence of each law for traces of \
  differentiation. We find that the method can be used to identify DI in regulations at scale, the accuracy does \
  however not match human accuracy due to the complexity of differentiated integration. \
  The results of this analysis are presented in the files below.
agg-repo-fragment.hr-title = EU Human Resources Dataset 2020
agg-repo-fragment.ht-tab = Human Resources
agg-repo-fragment.ht-desc-1 = An administration is nothing without its staff. Without their employees, the European \
  institutions would not be able to implement any of their core tasks - from developing policies, to implementing \
  political decisions, to monitoring and evaluating funding programmes. The European Commission, for example, relied \
  on 32.847 staff members in 2020 and the European Parliament on more than 7500 .
agg-repo-fragment.ht-desc-2 = The job descriptions of these employees can provide valuable insights into the EU \
  human resources for different policy areas and political priorities. While the EU's 'Whoiswho' website provides \
  information on EU employees, it is unfortunately not available in machine readable format for larger scale analyses. \
  To this end, we have created the 'EU HR dataset', a dataset with the job title, unit title and hierarchy level of \
  EU employees listed on the EU's 'Whoiswho' website. It contains 29.645 observations for the European Commission, \
  5564 observations for the European Parliament and 5657 observations for other EU institutions. The dataset does not \
  contain any personal identifiers.
agg-repo-fragment.ht-desc-3 = The dataset can be used to analyse how many EU employees work on different topics, \
  by counting the number of employees who have, for example, key words like 'environment' in their job or unit title. \
  The counts can also be weighted based on the hierarchy level of each employee. Our analyses of EU autonomy in the \
  TRIGGER Deep Dives provides an example of this analysis.
agg-repo-fragment.ml-gov-title = New Actors in EU Multi-Level Governance
agg-repo-fragment.ml-gov-tab = Multi-Level Governance
agg-repo-fragment.ml-gov-desc-1 = Who governs the European Union (EU) and how? The established literature on EU \
  multi-level governance explains the EU's governance system by analysing the role of the different EU and member \
  state actors at all levels of governance. We contribute to this research by demonstrating how a new dataset of \
  142.036 EU laws enables new research into EU governance.
agg-repo-fragment.ml-gov-desc-2 = More specifically, we use Natural Language Processing methods to analyse emerging \
  actors in EU secondary law. First, this analysis provides new empirical proof of a phenomenon called \
  'agencification' - the increasing power of EU technical agencies since the 1950s until today. Second, it shows that \
  NGOs and civil society have also become more prominent in EU law, but their primary powers lie outside of the \
  EU's legal framework.
agg-repo-fragment.global-gov-title = Global Governance Data Sets
agg-repo-fragment.gg-regimes-title = Global Governance Regimes, Tools and Approaches
agg-repo-fragment.gg-regimes-tab = Global Governance
agg-repo-fragment.gg-regimes-desc-1 = Global governance is a multidimensional phenomenon of transnational political \
  and institutional practice. It has become a key reference point for the management of transnational and global \
  interactions in a multipolar international political system, in which public authority and political sovereignty \
  are dispersed across political levels and entities. Because of such dispersion, modes of global governance are \
  complex and multifaceted expressions of regulatory demand and practice within transnational politics. They manifest \
  structures, exercise and outcomes of political power and public authority in multi-actor international \
  decision-making constellations. In their most integrated and integrative forms, they could be understood as the \
  closest the international community gets to participatory and accountable collective action at global level.
agg-repo-fragment.gg-regimes-desc-2 = Focusing on oftentimes far-reaching aspects of global politics, institutions \
  and modes of global governance require thorough analysis in order to identify their benefits and potential. \
  To properly assess global governance solutions, their focus and role in global politics need to be analysed and \
  evaluated. It is through such assessment that the understanding of their contribution to collective action at \
  global level helps frame the leeway for EU actorness and effectiveness to influence the rules-based delivery of \
  global public goods. Global governance regimes, tools and approaches provide the international environment in which \
  the EU engages in. They affect the EU's potential to influence global politics, form opportunity structures and \
  represent constraints that frame the EU's capacity to act. At the same time, the EU's engagement shapes global \
  governance, establishing a feedback loop between institutions of global governance and EU actorness and \
  effectiveness to influence global politics. In this multidirectional perspective, global governance creates the \
  ecosystem for EU actorness to unfold and provides the backdrop, target and momentum for the EU to act globally. \
  Stocktaking of the features of global governance is therefore an entry point into the analysis of the EU's role \
  in global governance.
agg-repo-fragment.int-reg-coop-title = International Regulatory Cooperation
agg-repo-fragment.int-reg-coop-tab = International Regulatory Cooperation
agg-repo-fragment.int-reg-coop-desc-1 = International regulatory cooperation (IRC) has increased tremendously over \
  the past decades. IRC encompasses many different types and degrees of cooperation: From integration through \
  supranational institutions like the EU, to informal dialogues such as the transatlantic dialogue; from cooperation \
  between states in trade agreements, to regulatory cooperation between private actors in transnational private \
  networks. Understanding the different types of regulatory cooperation is crucial for better understanding the \
  EU's position in global governance. In order to enhance the understanding of international regulatory cooperation, \
  we therefore collected several datasets on different types of cooperation. We make these datasets available for the \
  research community and we will explore them in our future analyses of the EU's actorness in global governance.
agg-repo-fragment.measure-gov-title = Measuring Governance Performance as a Global Governance Instruments
agg-repo-fragment.measure-gov-tab = Measuring Governance
agg-repo-fragment.measure-gov-desc-1 = Among the many tools of global governance, measuring governance performance \
  and quality has become an important instrument of development agendas (given that 'good' governance has become a \
  development goal (SDG 16) in itself) and of international politics (where governance measures are seen as a means \
  of political pressure on states' behaviour and as a scrutiny tool for international organisations). This increased \
  relevance of governance for the development agendas of international organisations and states however requires an \
  assessment of how governance is exactly measured. TRIGGER takes up previous research of consortium members and \
  continues contributing to this reflection by analysing diverse governance measures that are used as \
  instruments of global governance.
agg-repo-fragment.measure-gov-desc-2 = The dataset brings together comparative data on a set of relevant \
  characteristics of governance performance measures. It aims to represent a valid overview of existing measures \
  of both state and international organisational performance and hence includes a variety of measures that are \
  broadly considered governance measures, even if they capture different aspects and dimensions of governance and \
  are used by different entities.
agg-repo-fragment.transnational-title = Transnational Private Regulatory Regimes, Schemes and Standards
agg-repo-fragment.transnational-tab = Transnational Regimes
agg-repo-fragment.transnational-desc-1 = Private modes of governance remain a complex and multifaceted political \
  reality and regulatory practice at transnational and global level. They essentially manifest structures, exercise \
  and outcomes of private cooperation and regulation in multilevel, multi-actor constellations.
agg-repo-fragment.transnational-desc-2 = Transnational private regulatory regimes (i.e., particular ways of organising \
  and operating a sector, business, and/or activity), schemes (i.e., officially organised plans or systems), and \
  standards (i.e., principles of quality or conduct used as a measure, norm, or model) therefore belong to one of the \
  most vibrant areas of global governance. In the realm of transnational private regulation, new modes of governance \
  have emerged that foster the quality, efficiency, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the private schemes, shifting \
  outwards the possibility frontier in the management of complex value chains and trade agreements. Such private \
  regulatory practice represents different new governance configurations and meta-regulatory approaches developed \
  by private actors.

deep-dives-fragment.intro-to-dd-title = Introduction to the Deep Dives
deep-dives-fragment.intro-to-dd-desc-1 = This report illustrates how the TRIGGER model of actorness and effectiveness \
  can be applied to four key policy areas: climate policy, sustainable development goals, development policy and \
  relations with Africa, as well as data protection. Each of these four 'deep dives' follows a common structure: \
  First, EU and global governance in the respective policy area is analysed, to determine the internal and external \
  governance structure in which the EU is acting. Second, each of the seven dimensions of actorness is analysed using \
  a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The outcomes of these analyses are condensed in standardised \
  expert judgements on the level of actorness of the EU for each dimension on a scale from low to high, to make the \
  analyses comparable across topics. Moreover, the analyses are repeated for at least two time periods in each deep \
  dive, enabling us to sketch the development of EU actorness over time. The methodological annex provides details on \
  new experimental approaches for analysing specific dimensions of actorness using computational media analysis \
  methods. Third, following the actorness analysis, within each policy area one or more salient cases in which the \
  EU's effectiveness can be studied are selected. In each selected case, the analysis identifies the EU's own external \
  goals and evaluates to what extent these goals have been achieved by comparing the goals with the outcome. \
  Last, building on the preceding chapters, a concluding chapter will highlight the factors that we believe are likely \
  to determine the EU's actorness and effectiveness in the selected policy domains in the future.
deep-dives-fragment.climate-policy-tab = Climate Policy
deep-dives-fragment.climate-policy-title = Deep Dive: Climate Policy
deep-dives-fragment.climate-policy-desc-1 = Over the past 30 years, climate policy has grown into an established \
  policy field, which generates its political relevance particularly at the international level. Since the United \
  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) emerged from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, anthropogenic climate \
  change has become acknowledged as a multi-faceted problem that calls for integrated governance responses across \
  the globe. Aside from distinctive institutions explicitly equipped with climate governance, climate policy has \
  been mainstreamed into other policy arenas based upon the cross-cutting nature of increasing problem pressure \
  (Guzman 2016). The mainstreaming has resulted in increasingly complex structures involving a variety of actors, \
  interests, institutions and policy channels and instruments at different levels of governance (state and non-state).
deep-dives-fragment.climate-policy-desc-2 = Although fragmentation remains a key characteristic of global climate \
  governance, a form of key architecture established over the past decades around which most governance evolves. \
  This chapter is interested in making sense of this key global governance architecture and how it relates to the EU. \
  The time frame for the analysis of this chapter looks at developments from the pre-Kyoto phase to Glasgow in 2021. \
  The Kyoto Protocol is one of the key areas where the EU considers itself an 'over-achiever' (EC 2013). The EU's \
  engagement around the successor of the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Climate Agreement (2016) further solidified this \
  impression and is expected to manifest the EU's commitment to the European Green Deal at the next conference of the \
  Parties (COP) in Glasgow 2021. At the same time, Copenhagen marks a discontinuity of the EU's self-proclaimed image \
  as a leader and has been heatedly debated as a case of contested EU leadership and actorness. Therefore, these data \
  points were chosen to set the time frame for the analysis.
deep-dives-fragment.climate-policy-desc-3 = Aside from the manifold volumes that have been written on global climate \
  governance and climate policy in EU politics, the following chapter briefly revisits major developments in the \
  governance of climate policy. The chapter begins by reflecting on the need for climate governance at the global \
  level. The subsequent sections look at the main elements of current climate governance architecture (section 1.2), \
  its core principles (section 1.3), policy pathways (section 1.4) and the sectoral nature of climate policymaking \
  (section 1.5). The paper proceeds to analyse EU governance of climate change (chapter 2) and how the EU has \
  implemented this core architecture (section 2.1). The chapter also looks at EU focus areas in climate policy \
  throughout time, key aspects of EU policymaking, instruments and policy pathways (section 2.2) and actors involved \
  (section 2.3). The last section outlines major developments regarding international regulatory cooperation \
  (chapter 2.4). All chapter sections contain a dynamic element by reflecting upon how governance changed over time.

deep-dives-fragment.sdg-tab = Sustainable Development Goals
deep-dives-fragment.sdg-title = Deep Dive: Sustainable Development Goals
deep-dives-fragment.sdg-desc-1 = Sustainable development is an essential precondition for the flourishing and \
  long-term survival of human life on earth. While pessimistic analysts of the past century of human economic activity \
  can point to a long history of environmental destruction and short-termist behaviour, optimistic observers can point \
  to a growing framework of governance arrangements and policy initiatives designed to foster sustainable development. \
  This chapter analyses the governance of sustainable development and focuses on the EU's capability to act and be \
  effective in this domain.
deep-dives-fragment.sdg-desc-2 = Our analysis of sustainable development proceeds in four interrelated sections. \
  First, we provide an overview of the main global and EU governance arrangements. Second, we analyse the EU's \
  actorness in sustainable development policy. Using the TRIGGER actorness model outlined in the introduction to this \
  deliverable, the second section analyses the level of EU actorness across the seven dimensions of actorness during \
  two phases: The 'MDG phase' after 2000 and the 'SDG phase' after 2015. Third, we analyse the EU's effectiveness in \
  sustainable development policy. Defining effectiveness as goal attainment, we start by outlining the main goals and \
  instruments of the EU when it comes to promoting sustainable development. We then dive deeper into two case studies \
  on the CETA trade agreement and standards for sustainability reporting to analyse the degree of goal attainment in \
  these two cases. Lastly, we conclude our chapter by outlining the main challenges and opportunities lying ahead of \
  the EU. Meaningful action for sustainable development is both urgent and possible, even in the wake of past and \
  future catastrophes like the COVID-19 pandemic.

deep-dives-fragment.dpra-tab = EU-Africa partnership & development aid
deep-dives-fragment.dpra-title = Deep Dive: EU-Africa partnership & development aid
deep-dives-fragment.dpra-desc-1 = This document aims to give an overview of the evolution of global and European \
  governance in development policy and relations with Africa.
deep-dives-fragment.dpra-desc-2 = The research is focused on the period between 1995 and the present. Nevertheless, \
  both for global governance and European governance some references will be provided relating to the pre-1995 period.
deep-dives-fragment.dpra-desc-3 = The analysis of governance starts with an overview of development policy and \
  relations with African evolution since the decolonisation process. The analysis covers the evolution of development \
  and cooperation with Africa from the perspective of some key international organisations and certain key bilateral \
  actors. The analysis focuses on the European Union's governance, starting from the EU's framework for development \
  and cooperation with North Africa and with Sub-Saharan Africa and then to look at the continent-to-continent \
  approach between the European Union and Africa as a whole.

deep-dives-fragment.data-prot-tab = Data Protection
deep-dives-fragment.data-prot-title = Deep Dive: Data Protection
deep-dives-fragment.data-prot-desc-1 = Data protection is one of the most important policy domains for the EU in terms \
  of its global governance ambitions and successes. It is routinely cited as a paradigmatic case of the so-called \
  Brussels effect (Bradford 2020, 2012), and after decades of consistent consolidation and development the EU's data \
  protection framework is now an unavoidable point of reference for the growing number of countries that are \
  developing frameworks of their own (Greenleaf 2021). In this deep dive, we assess the evolution of the EU's data \
  protection framework from the perspective of the TRIGGER model of actorness and effectiveness (Teebken, Jacob, and \
  Guske 2019).
deep-dives-fragment.data-prot-desc-2 = The data protection analysis proceeds in four stages. In our first chapter, we \
  outline how data protection governance, in the EU and globally, has evolved since the 1980s. We highlight the \
  steady progression in the EU from a patchy set of national data protection measures through to the implementation of \
  the GDPR since 2018. In the second chapter, we focus on actorness. We assess how the EU has performed over time on \
  each of the seven dimensions in the TRIGGER actorness model. We look at three broad periods: from 1980 until the \
  1995 Data Protection Directive, from the directive through to the agreement of the GDPR, and the period since then. \
  In the third chapter, we turn to consider effectiveness, which is defined in terms of external goal attainment. \
  The effectiveness chapter also includes two case studies that focus on narrower 'micro' goals in specific \
  negotiation contexts: the EU's Privacy Shield negotiations with the US, and its work with the Council of Europe to \
  ensure that the CoE's revised Convention 108 is aligned with the GDPR. The deep dive then concludes with a short \
  final section which highlights four factors that in our view are likely to be important determinants of the outlook \
  for the EU in the data protection domain. These are (i) the need to prevent slippage on data protection \
  fundamentals, such as consent; (ii) continuing challenges related to national fragmentation; (iii) possible \
  trade-offs between strong data protection and levels of EU innovation and growth; and (iv) the prospect of further \
  increases in the EU's international influence.

deep-dives-fragment.access-data-btn = Access documents

technology-fragment.title = Technology Papers
technology-fragment.paper-1-tab = Open Standards & OSS
technology-fragment.paper-1-title = TRIGGER Deliverable 4.1 - Review of current governance regimes and EU initiatives \
  concerning Open Standards and OSS
technology-fragment.paper-1-desc-1 = For more than two decades, the European Commission has promoted the use of open \
  source software (OSS) and open standards by public institutions on the European Union (EU) and member state levels. \
  The creation of technical interoperability between the information and communications technologies (ICT) of \
  different EU countries and institutions has been one important rationale for the promotion of OSS and open \
  standards. More interoperability, the reasoning went, would speed up the creation of the digital single market and \
  lead to more innovation and competition among different ICT providers, thereby fostering economic growth in the\
   Union's member states. The promotion of OSS and open standards is moreover a powerful geopolitical tool. A second \
  important rationale for the EU's policies therefore was to strengthen its position in global technology governance \
  and support its domestic ICT industry by undermining (mostly) US-based proprietary software firms. Now, more than \
  twenty years after the Commission began promoting OSS and open standards, it is time to take stock and assess \
  whether the EU's policies truly are fostering interoperability and making the Union a more powerful actor in global \
  technology governance.
technology-fragment.paper-1-desc-2 = As regards the first policy goal, OSS and open standards can indeed contribute to \
  more interoperability. The relationship between OSS and interoperability is, however, not straightforward. \
  Not all OSS developers prioritize interoperability, which means that governments need to provide incentives for OSS \
  developers to create interoperable solutions. The contribution of a standard to interoperability increases with the \
  actual openness of the standard. However, governments face a trade-off between requiring complete openness - which \
  necessitates the free sharing of standard-essential patents (SEPs) - and incentivizing investments in research and \
  development (R&D). Policymakers therefore need to decide to what extent and at what cost they want to promote \
  interoperability through open standards. This decision is complicated by the fact that scientific research has not \
  been able to establish a clear link between the promotion of interoperability and the creation of more innovation \
  and competition in countries' ICT industries. As regards geopolitics, the promotion of OSS and open standards can be \
  a powerful tool for states to improve their economic and political positions vis-à-vis their rivals. Thus, the \
  promotion of open standards can strengthen the economies of those countries whose domestic firms are either, on \
  balance, SEP implementers or treat their intellectual property as a factor of production rather than a revenue source.

technology-fragment.paper-2-tab = Distributed Ledger Technologies
technology-fragment.paper-2-title = TRIGGER Deliverable 4.2 - Taking stock of existing trends and forward-looking \
  scenarios in the application and governance of distributed ledger technologies
technology-fragment.paper-2-desc-1 = The potential of blockchain technology and distributed ledgers have received a \
  lot of attention in the public discussion in recent years. Since the advent of the first widely known use case of \
  blockchain technology in 2008, the concepts in the field have gone through a number of evolutionary phases, \
  expanding in breadth and taking on new meanings. The expansion in terminology has largely led to inflated and \
  erroneous beliefs about the revolutionary effects of the phenomenon.
technology-fragment.paper-2-desc-2 = Several public and private institutions have taken an interest in blockchain \
  technology and distributed ledgers lately. Multiple public and private research and development initiatives, as well \
  as combinations of the two, have been established in Europe, just as in the United States and China. However, \
  despite the hype and a multitude of announced initiatives, published documentations of the development \
  projects - successful or otherwise - are extremely few and far in between. Furthermore, descriptions of lessons \
  learned and practical insights, usually available for other developing technologies, seem virtually nonexistent with \
  blockchain. The lack of evidence indicates that companies have not been able to execute on the promise of blockchain \
  and distributed ledger technology (DLT) (Burg, Murphy, and Pétraud 2018).
technology-fragment.paper-2-desc-3 = By describing blockchain technology first and foremost as an alternative method \
  for deploying digital platforms and fostering their network effects through a grassroots level approach, this report \
  makes an effort to provide a better understanding of the strengths and challenges as well as the opportunities and \
  threats to global governance from blockchain and DLT. As a case example of the potential benefits, the realm of \
  product life cycle management in global supply chains is examined.
technology-fragment.paper-2-desc-4 = From a global governance standpoint, the key implication is that blockchain \
  technology has enabled a new kind of a distributed computational paradigm for rethinking how to organize human \
  collaboration and interaction. Despite the technological possibilities, the governance of these alternative \
  applications is complicated by the fact that established social paradigms of interaction taking place on top of \
  blockchain-platforms have not yet fully manifested amongst the general public.

technology-fragment.paper-3-tab = EU & AI
technology-fragment.paper-3-title = TRIGGER Deliverable 4.3 - Review of current governance regimes and EU initiatives \
  concerning AI (working paper)
technology-fragment.paper-3-desc-1 = This report is concerned with the governance implications of artificial \
  intelligence and machine learning. Machine-learning models can be used to automate decisions in an ever-widening \
  range of contexts and this automated decision-making can be deployed in ways that have a material impact on people's \
  lives, from shaping the content of a social media newsfeed to determining whether or not someone should be \
  incarcerated. As this phenomenon of automated decision-making increases in scope, so too does the need for processes \
  to ensure the appropriate governance of these technologies.
technology-fragment.paper-3-desc-2 = Applying these techniques to large datasets opens new possibilities in terms of \
  analysing, predicting and even optimising human and institutional behaviour and decisions. This has led to machine \
  learning being deployed across a rapidly widening range of sectors such as transportation, insurance, health and \
  medical services, administration, media and advertising, and the military.
technology-fragment.paper-3-desc-3 = As the sophistication and widespread use of machine learning has accelerated in \
  recent years, the governance landscape has evolved in response. There has been a proliferation of initiatives and \
  strategy documents aimed at establishing the kind of governance guardrails that will allow the potential benefits \
  of machine learning to be exploited while mitigating potential risks. The governance landscape is dominated by the \
  actions of three key players: the EU, the US and China.
technology-fragment.paper-3-desc-4 = A survey of the governance landscape identifies two main responses to machine \
  learning: on the one hand, viewing it as a source of innovation, growth and competitiveness to be actively promoted, \
  and on the other hand, viewing it as a source of potential societal disruption to be managed with caution. These are \
  not mutually exclusive responses?on the contrary, the key factor is how different countries and regions seek to \
  balance them. In general terms, the current situation is that the US and China are technologically and economically \
  dominant in the machine-learning field, while the EU is more advanced in its governance approach, which is evolving \
  towards a sophisticated regulatory framework designed to protect safety, consumer rights and fundamental rights.

technology-fragment.paper-4-tab = Cross-cutting Themes
technology-fragment.paper-4-title = TRIGGER Deliverable 4.4 - Cross-cutting themes: principles and guidelines for an \
  overarching governance framework
technology-fragment.paper-4-desc-1 = Over the past three decades, the emergence of the digital economy has created \
  both opportunities and challenges for the European Union, affecting its ability to shape both global and internal \
  governance. This paper takes stock of current developments in digital technology, with a view to discussing future \
  avenues for EU and global governance. Accordingly, Section 1 below summarises the main foundations of the digital \
  economy, the main trends observed in the first three decades of the Internet and the challenges they pose for \
  regulators, particularly EU ones. Section 2 summarises the additional insights emerging from the TRIGGER papers, in \
  particular for what concerns technologies such as machine learning and DLTs; and the EU's approach towards openness \
  and interoperability, both in standardisation and in software architectures and solutions. The same section also \
  discusses emerging tensions and the evolution towards a new approach to the Single Market. Section 3 discusses \
  current EU actorness and effectiveness in the digital domain and analyses the possible evolution of the EU and the \
  global governance of digital technologies.

technology-fragment.paper-5-tab = Explorative Scenarios
technology-fragment.paper-5-title = TRIGGER Deliverable 4.5 - Explorative scenarios of governance by and of emerging \
  technologies with far-reaching consequences on society and the economy
technology-fragment.paper-5-desc-1 = The rise of the digital economy requires a radical change in the policies for \
  the Single Market, as well as in the trade policies that underpin the whole market integration process. Trends such \
  as the virtualisation, servitisation and platformisation of the economy (as described below), coupled with the rise \
  of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, make market integration at once more appealing and \
  increasingly challenging for EU policymakers, projecting the Single Market into a complete new dimension, in which \
  the "Fifth Freedom" (the free circulation of non-personal data) is intertwined with new concerns with the need to \
  protect fundamental rights, and at the same time secure Europe's technological sovereignty.
technology-fragment.paper-5-desc-2 = As EU institutions were struggling to complete the ambitious Digital Single \
  Market strategy formulated by the Juncker Commission, technology has changed so fast that brand new policy \
  initiatives are needed: the Von der Leyen Commission seems to have marked a significant change towards a more \
  assertive and future-oriented approach to digital policy. The new pillars of the Single Market 2.0 are not focused \
  anymore on platform regulation, data protection and the free flow of non-personal data; while these remain very \
  important pillars, the future of the Single Market will require that the whole internal market is seen as a layered \
  ecosystem, in which infrastructure, rules, protocols and standards become a platform for large and small companies \
  to develop value added solutions to the benefit of all European consumers.
technology-fragment.paper-5-desc-3 = Can code succeed where law and politics have so far partly failed? In the \
  remainder of this chapter, I outline the possible contours of a "Single Market 2.0". Section 1 below describes the \
  current and the upcoming waves of digital transformation as featuring very different economic paradigms and \
  consequences for EU policy. Section 2 discusses the reconfiguration of the Single Market as a layered ecosystem and \
  describe the current Digital Single Market Strategy and the upcoming initiatives outlined by the European \
  Commission, and partly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 3 provides a layered architecture for the Single \
  Market 2.0 and outlines possible further avenues to speed up reform in a way that is consistent with all the \
  cornerstones of the EU strategy for growth and sustainable development. Section 4 discusses the consequences for EU \
  actorness and effectiveness in the digital economy, and discusses possible EU policy options in the mid- to \
  long-term. Section 5 briefly concludes.

cop26-fragment.intro = Social media data offers a rich source for analysing the views of individuals on ongoing (political) processes. What are the concerns of twitterers in the context of COP 26 in Glasgow and related issues? More specifically, we are interested in how European institutions are perceived in this context. For this purpose, we are collecting tweets to offer a live-analysis before and during the Glasgow Climate Summit. We include those tweets in our analysis that include keywords such are climate change, climate policy or COP26. <br></br> For the selection of tweets mentioning these keywords, we examine whether reference is made to the EU or European institutions. We ask this in addition to English tweets for different languages: French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese and Swedish: the governments of these countries have very different positions on European climate policy. Is this also true for people from these countries? <br></br> We apply sentiment analysis to analyse the feelings expressed on climate change and climate policy. <br></br> Finally, we examine what issues and topics twitterers are engaged with. The likely topics of the conference are grouped into the following issue areas: sectors, affected communities, policy instruments, monitoring, contribution distribution or level of ambition). Here the frequency of use of related keywords is analysed <br></br> <b>Graphs are updated at 9:00 a.m. CET and 9:00 p.m. CET</b>.
